# Menu App
A full-stack application that allows users to create individual profiles to add and store restaurant menus for ease of access.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS

I worked my way backwards through the MVC process by taking a previous project I worked on (to-do app). I made sure all the routes/controllers/views were specific to this project. I set up my database on MongoDB and made sure my ejs had access to the correct files. I tested along the way to make sure the app was working the way I wanted. Finally, I added styling to make the app easy to use.  
## Optimizations

I would love to refine the look of this app to be a little bit more interesting to look at but over all I believe the functionality of this app is good.

## Lessons Learned:

Although it is not the most appealing project, it is an extremely simple way to have menus at the ready which is good when I'm starving. This project helped me understand the MVC process more thoroughly and adding authentication was a new element I hadn't explored before.
